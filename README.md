2. Create a new script and paste the contents of `pixiv-unfollow.user.js` into it.
3. Visit your following list page:  
   `https://www.pixiv.net/users/YOUR_ID/following?p=1`

   - Unfollow all users on the current page.

‚ö†Ô∏è Warnings

- Recommended delay is `1000-1500ms` to avoid rate-limiting or temporary bans.
